We include two Macaulay2 files, each containing multiple functions.

MatrixSchubert.m2:
1. NorthWest - finds the NW set in the Rothe diagram of a given permutation in one-line notation.
2. dominantpiece - finds the dominant piece of a permutation in one-line notation.
3. dimY - finds the dimension of the affine variety Y_w, where the matrix Schubert variety is equal to Y_w x a torus of maximal dimension. Again, w is given in one line notation. 
4. dimWeightConeMS - finds the dimension of the weight cone of the usual torus action on the matrix Schubert variety. The permutation is the input in one line notation.
5. complexityMS - computes the complexity of the matrix Schubert variety under the usual torus action. The permutation is the input in one line notation.


Kazhdan Lusztig:
1. KLideal - gives the generators of the Kazhdan Lusztig ideal of two permutations, each given in one line notation. 
2. dimWeightConeKL - computes the dimension of the weight cone of the two permutations, with respect to the usual torus action.
3. complexityKL - computes the complexity of the Kazhdan Lusztig variety for two permutations in one-line notation.
